# Intelligent-IoT-Security-Frameworks

This is the coding practise for AI on IoT security, or the state-of-the art machine learning and deep learning techniques to construct an intelligent security model for the Internet of Things.
There will be multiple models being or to be constructed based on many considerations, such as the infrastructure of IoT (edge, fog, or central cloud), various attacks for each layer or application (such as botnet, phishing, ransom, etc.), various publicly published datasets (such as NSL-KDD, BoT-IoT, CIC-IoT, etc.), various learning algorithms (Decision Tree, SVM, Naive Bayes, CNN, etc.), various running environments (Google Colab, Jupyter, Kaggle, etc.), and so on.
The purpose of this repo is to inspire new ideas, implement coding practises, and construct and verify models while keeping pace with the state-of-the-art solutions proposed by academics and industries. So, besides creating models, writing about the interesting ideas of other academics will also be provided.

### Datasets for Security
